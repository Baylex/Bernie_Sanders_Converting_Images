# Converting Images
## Purpose and Process
Transformation Waco needed a greyscaled logo to match with other logos for a communication project.
I searched for a popular image to use for practice and landed on using the Bernie Sanders meme.

## Using PIL library to convert images
I used the PIL library in python and jupyter notebook.  
Research showed that PIL is being retired and will soon be changed to PILLOW in future updates.

# Finding an Original Image: 
Image Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders_mittens_meme

## Bernie Sanders Image Meme used for the Original Image

## Converting to Greyscale, then converting to Black and White for a Monochrome image Using L
